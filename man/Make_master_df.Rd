Layout tables.}

\value{
A data frame object that contains the OD measurements from a
all the plates from all runs included, combined with the Runs and Layout
information. Columns correspond to those included in Runs and Layout tables.
In addition, `Make_master_df()` creates a series of variables to identify
each curve and each measurement. They are:
* `ID`: numeric value where the thousands and tens of thousands positions
correspond to the plate number [1 to # of plates]. Hundreds position is
the row number [1 to 8]. Tens and units are the columns [01 to 12]. In the
case of 24-well plates, the aforementioned values range from [1 to 4] for
rows and from [1 to 6] for the columns.
* `RRPPRCC`: Unique curve identifier, representing
(Run, Run, Plate, Plate, Row (in plate [1 to 8]), Column (in plate [01 to 12])).
In the case of 24-well plates, the aforementioned values range from [1 to 4]
for rows and from [1 to 6] for the columns.
