Reads excel files from TECAN plate reader and converts the data
into a long data frame object. It assumes that each sheet corresponds to
a single 96-well plate. Time is converted to hours instead of days. An identifier
field is created, where digits corresponding to thousands and tens of thousands
indicate the plate number [1 to #plates]; hundreds indicates the row number [1 to 8];
tens and units are the columns [1 to 12].
